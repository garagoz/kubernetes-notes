### ----------------- Drain and Cordon a node -----------------------------
1. kubectl cordon <node-name>
When you cordon a node, you mark it as unschedulable, meaning new pods will not be scheduled on that node. 
However, it does not affect the running pods. The node remains operational, and any pods already running on it 
will continue running until they are terminated or moved by another operation


2. kubectl drain <node-name>
When you drain a node, it goes a step further than cordon. Draining involves:
Cordoning the node to make it unschedulable.
Evicting all running pods from the node so they can be rescheduled on other available nodes.
