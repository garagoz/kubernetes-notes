Kubernetes cluster can be installed in a two way

------ with kubeadm tool -------
1. With kubeadm tool, in this way, each compenent runs as pod under kube-system namespace
   cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/component-name
2. kubeadm tool doesnt install kubelet, we install it ourself



------ From scratch ---------
1. With scratch, you downlaod each component and run it as systemd service
  ps aux | grep component-name
