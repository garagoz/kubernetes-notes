Let's talk a little about RBAC resources:

A ClusterRole|Role defines a set of permissions and where it is available, in the whole cluster or just a single Namespace.

A ClusterRoleBinding|RoleBinding connects a set of permissions with an account and defines where it is applied, in the whole cluster or just a single Namespace.

Because of this there are 4 different RBAC combinations and 3 valid ones:

1. Role + RoleBinding (available in single Namespace, applied in single Namespace)
2. ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding (available cluster-wide, applied cluster-wide)
3. ClusterRole + RoleBinding (available cluster-wide, applied in single Namespace)
4. Role + ClusterRoleBinding (NOT POSSIBLE: available in single Namespace, applied cluster-wide)
